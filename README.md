# Faasd CI/CD pipeline
 
Testing out CI/CD pipeline using faasd as outlined by Alex Ellis book serverless for everyone else chapter 11.

He has an updated guide here https://www.openfaas.com/blog/edge-actions/ which is more useful than the one specified in the book in my opinion.

Currently, I have the pipeline setup to publish when pushing to remote branches and deploying when a pull request is merged to my local raspberry pi 4.
